## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `onshape-api` for local development. Please note this documentation assumes you already have `poetry` and `Git` installed and ready to go.

Fork the `onshape-api` repo on GitHub.

Clone your fork locally:

```sh
cd <directory_in_which_repo_should_be_created>
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/onshape-api.git
```

Now we need to install the environment. Navigate into the directory

```sh
cd onshape-api
```

Then, install and activate the environment with:

```sh
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Please ensure that poetry is installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Install pre-commit to run linters/formatters at commit time:

```sh
poetry run pre-commit install
```

Create a branch for local development:

```sh
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

Don't forget to add test cases for your added functionality to the [tests](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) directory.

When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the formatting tests.

```sh
make check
```

Now, validate that all unit tests are passing:

```sh
make test
```

Before raising a pull request you should also run tox. This will run the tests across different versions of Python:

```sh
tox
```

This requires you to have multiple versions of python installed. This step is also triggered in the CI/CD pipeline, so you could also choose to skip this step locally.

Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in [README.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/1).
