# Developer Documentation

This document provides an overview of how the onshape-robotics-toolkit library works internally and how different components interact with each other.

## Architecture Overview

The library is organized into several key components:
- **Client**: Handles all communication with the Onshape API
- **Robot**: Manages the robot model creation and URDF export
- **Assembly**: Represents the CAD assembly structure
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for various operations

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Authentication and Connection
The library first establishes a secure connection with Onshape:
- Users provide API credentials (access key and secret key)
- The Client component handles authentication and maintains the session
- All subsequent API requests use this authenticated session

### 2. Document Access
Once authenticated:
- The library can access Onshape documents using either URLs or direct document IDs
- Document metadata is retrieved to verify access and get necessary identifiers
- Assembly information is cached to minimize API calls

### 3. Assembly Processing
The assembly processing workflow:
1. Retrieves the full assembly structure from Onshape
2. Parses the hierarchical relationship between components
3. Identifies joints, mate connectors, and other relevant features
4. Creates an internal representation of the robot structure

### 4. URDF Generation
The URDF export process:
1. Analyzes the assembly structure
2. Maps Onshape constraints to URDF joints
3. Exports geometry in specified formats
4. Generates a complete URDF file with proper kinematics

- Caches responses when appropriate

### Robot Class
- Represents the complete robot model
- Manages the conversion from CAD assembly to URDF
- Handles coordinate transformations
- Provides visualization utilities

### Assembly Class
- Represents the CAD assembly structure
- Maintains parent-child relationships
- Tracks mate connections and constraints
- Manages geometric transformations
